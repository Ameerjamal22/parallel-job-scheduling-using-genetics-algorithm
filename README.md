# parallel-shop-scheduling-using-genetics-algorithm
 This project uses a genetic algorithm to optimize job scheduling on multiple machines, minimizing makespan and average completion time. It reads job data from a file, initializes job schedules, and evolves them through crossover, mutation, and selection, resulting in an optimized schedule with detailed machine timelines.
